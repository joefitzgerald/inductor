### Introduction

Inductor generates Packer templates (*.json) and associated files using Go [text/template](http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) templates. The initial focus will be to generate templates for [packer-windows](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/packer-windows) â€” additional operating systems may follow.
